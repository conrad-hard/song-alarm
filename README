README - SONG ALARM

Song Alarm is a simple application for Android for playing a song when an alarm
fires at a set time.  The Android Open Source Project's AlarmClock application
does not support this (not sure about DeskClock, its replacement).  There are
non-free applications on the Market that have this feature, but I wouldn't buy
an app just for this feature.

Enjoy and wake up to your favorite song!  Songs can be downloaded from digital
music stores like Amazon.

See GitHub issues for known bugs to be fixed or resolved.
