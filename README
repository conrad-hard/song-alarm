README - SONG ALARM

Song Alarm is a simple application for Android for playing a song when an alarm
fires at a set time.  The Android Open Source Project's AlarmClock application
does not support this (not sure about DeskClock, its replacement).  There are
non-free applications on the Market that have this feature, but I wouldn't buy
an app just for this feature.

Enjoy and wake up to your favorite song!  Songs can be downloaded from digital
music stores like Amazon.

PUBLICATION TO MARKET
