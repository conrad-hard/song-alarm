README - SONG ALARM ICONS

These files were created with Inkscape.  Only their derivatives should be in
the application package.

song-alarm-512.svg 
	Used to create the 512x512 image required by Android Market

ic_launcher.svg
	Used to create Launcher icons for different screen densities

The PNG versions put into resources were created from these files using the 
export feature in Inkscape:

	File >> Export bitmap . . .

Set the bitmap size to the appropriate size from the UI design guidelines for
the screen density (ldpi, mdpi, etc.).  The x0 and y0 values should be 0.
The x1 and y1 values should be width and height of the svg icon respectively.
